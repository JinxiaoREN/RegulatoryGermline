# RegulatoryGermline #

>The TCGA PanCanAtlas germline working group is investigating germline variants in the largest sequencing cohort of cancer to date: 10,389 cases in 33 cancer types. We have conducted extensive analysis on pathogenic coding variants. In this project we will investigate the roles of regulatory variants.

## Getting started: ##  
>1) Install Google Cloud SDK (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) and read through at least the basic gsutil command 
>2) Make sure you can access the project on Google cloud (https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=isb-cgc-06-0004); if not here are some relevant steps (http://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/webapp/Gaining-Access-To-Contolled-Access-Data.html)  
>3) Read this one page quick start to google cloud compute engine (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstarts) . 
>4) If you want to download the data to your local computer/cluster, you need to make sure with your system administrator that the environment you plan to work on have appropriate access authority and security.  
>5) Read Jay's short getting started guide (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0aS3CDIQ_RAd01ld0tKX3JHa00/view). And if you are up to it here is a more detailed guide by Sheila (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f1YBVG1dAhpF-Un5lp70kMI8Yo2rD3NNQdpl0FDAu-c/edit#heading=h.gv4f8tqq5731)
